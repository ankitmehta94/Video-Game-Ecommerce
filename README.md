This project is a Ecommerce Websit made in react redux, the data is from the igdb games api
This website has the following functionality
1 - Display a list of genres of games
2 - Display games of clicked genre (and display info for each game and option to add to cart or buy)
3 - Each game has its own page where we display more information and option to add to cart or buy
4 - Cart page where all items are displayed and totaled
5 - Add address and payment info(fake, obviously, unless you want to, which would be voluntary phishing )
